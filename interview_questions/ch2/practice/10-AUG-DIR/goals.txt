Goals for today:
    ********* LINKED LISTS THE CORRECT WAY NOW... OOPS ******
2.	Create Linked List: DONE
3.0	NEW - Append new node: DONE
3.1 NEW - Insert after specific node: DONE
3.2 NEW - Prepend new node: DONE
4.	Display new node: DONE
5.	Length new node: DONE
6.	Get specific node: DONE
7.	Delete specific data node by 'value': DONE
7.1 NEW - Delete node at specific postion in list: DONE
8.	Delete duplicate nodes: DONE
9.	Split the list in the middle: DONE
10.	Find last node: DONE
11.	Delete middle node: DONE
12.	Sum Two Lists: DONE
13. NEW - HACKY way to reverse: Did it because what is the harm :)
14. NEW - Reverse linked list: DONE ... now understand it.

5.5 HOURS LATER: I still haven't got to anything under this. BECAUSE the way I learned Linked
Lists was wrong so I had to go back and learn the right way. Everything here should be good
now! :D 

1.  REVERSE LINKED LIST:
        - RECURSIVE REVERSE:
2.	Palindrome
3.	Palindrome permutations
4.	Reversing a linked list

I will knock out all the linked list algos first, and probably quicker than today, then MASTER that reverse iteration algorithm THEN top it with doing a reverse recursion. I got this ;)
