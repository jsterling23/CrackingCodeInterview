Goals for today:

2.	Create Linked List: 
3.0	NEW - Append new node: DONE
3.1 NEW - Insert after specific node: DONE-Needs attention 
3.2 NEW - Prepend new node: DONE
4.	Display new node: DONE
5.	Length new node: DONE
6.	Get specific node by value(data): Kind of pointless because you may not know all the data for it to be that specific.
6.1 Get specific node in a list using index: DONE
7.  Delete specific node by index position: DONE
7.1	Delete specific data node by 'value': DONE
7.1 NEW - Delete node at specific postion in list: DONE 
8.	Delete duplicate nodes: DONE
9.	Split the list in the middle: DONE
10.	Find last node: DONE
11.	Delete middle node: DONE
12.	Sum Two Lists: DONE
13. NEW - HACKY way to reverse: Did it because what is the harm :)
14. NEW - Reverse linked list: DONE ... now understand it. DONE - I also understand it
15. NEW - Swap node with any other node in the list:

11am start. Lets do this


1.  REVERSE LINKED LIST: DONE
        - RECURSIVE REVERSE: DONE
2.	Palindrome: 
3.	Palindrome permutations:

I will knock out all the linked list algos first, and probably quicker than today, then MASTER that reverse iteration algorithm THEN top it with doing a reverse recursion. I got this ;)
